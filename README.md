To start downloading all files simply run:

    ./run.py

The scraping process still takes some time to complete. All the PO files will
be downloaded to the `files` folder organised by project subfolders.

If you just want the downloaded files, check out this
[BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/vmassuchetto/wordpress-translations)
repository automatically updated from time to time.
